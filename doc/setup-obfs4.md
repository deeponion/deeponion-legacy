### OBFS4 Proxy Setup

To run the Wallet with obfs4 enabled one must install the *obfs4proxy* [package](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/obfs4proxy) first. Also don't forget **to close your Wallet or daemon** before starting to change configuration files below.

#### Install obfs4proxy (Ubuntu, Debian)

```shell
sudo apt-get install obfs4proxy
```

#### Activate obfs4 functionality in DeepOnion.conf

Open your *DeepOnion.conf* and add those two lines:

```
torplugin=obfs4
torpluginpath=OBFS4PROXY_PATH (e.g. c:\bin\obfs4proxy.exe or /usr/bin/obfs4proxy)
```

To find the full path of the obfs4proxy executable you can also use those commands under Windows respective Linux/Mac:

`where obfs4proxy.exe`

`which obfs4proxy`

#### Find available Bridges

Visit this [website](https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges) to get a list of Bridges which you'll insert into the *torrc* file under your *datadir*.

#### Edit tor configuration file

Your *datadir* depends on the OS you're using. Possible locations of the *torrc* are:

* Windows - %APPDATA%/Roaming/DeepOnion/tor

This is the path under Windows.

![win-torrc-path](https://img2.picload.org/image/ddpcagra/torrc_path.png)

* Linux - ~/.DeepOnion/tor
* Mac -  ~/Library/Application Support/DeepOnion/tor

Open *torrc* and remove any lines that begin with *Bridge*. Now add the bridges you got from the above website with the keyword *Bridge* prepended.

Here's an example:

```
Bridge 80.92.79.70:80 312D64274C29156005843EECB19C6865FA3CC10C
Bridge 52.19.30.6:8443 FC5D6558344479BBB10E8638CC8CEB8BA6E32DAD
Bridge 178.63.28.14:443 88CB40E536DD6F6775626E6A3BCC5D9C0B7BAFEA
```

If you're editing this file under Windows, please take care of saving it as **torrc** only. Usually, Windows appends a file extension, like *txt*, which must be avoided. Therefore it's recommended to use an editor like [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.4.html). On saving the file you can select the option "All files" to save with the file name only.

![save-notepad](https://img3.picload.org/image/ddpclrrr/notepad.png)

Start your wallet, or daemon if running *headless*, and trace your tor's *logfile* with:

```
tail -f YOUR_DATADIR/tor/tor.log
```

You should see entries similar to those below:

```

### Windows Installation 

As Windows has no default Package Manager there are several ways to get **obfs4proxy.exe**. One could simply install the Tor-Browser manually and put the provided **obfs4proxy.exe** into the directory of your DeepOnion installation. 

There are also some open-source Package Managers for Windows available, like *choclolatey* for example. As **obfs4proxy.exe** is a [portable executable](https://tor.stackexchange.com/questions/14850/where-can-i-download-windows-binary-for-obfs4proxy) any of the possible ways is *correct* and it's up to the user to decide.

#### Installation with Chocolatey

[Install](https://chocolatey.org/install) Chocolatey package manager and then open a new DOS console. Type in the [following command](https://chocolatey.org/packages/tor-browser/7.0.2) (adapt the Tor version accordingly)

```
choco install tor-browser --version 7.0.2
```

#### Installation with Tor-Browser

[Download](https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en) the Tor-Browser installation package and run it..

#### Getting obfs4proxy.exe & making it available

After you've installed Tor search for **obfs4proxy.exe** within *Tor/PluggableTransports* inside your Tor-Browser's installation directory. 

![pluggable-transports-dir](https://img1.picload.org/image/ddpogdli/tor_path.png)

Copy this file to your Wallet's installation directory. Restart the Wallet. It will automatically find the file.

The output on Windows would look like this:
