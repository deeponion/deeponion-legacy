UNIX BUILD NOTES
================

The following are commands needed to build on ubuntu/debian from scratch (use sudo if you are not root). It is verified with ubuntu 16.04 and 17.04

First get the dependencies:

    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade
    apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev autoconf automake pkg-config libssl-dev libboost-all-dev bsdmainutils
    apt-get install libqrencode-dev libminiupnpc-dev libevent-dev libcap-dev libseccomp-dev git


    apt-get install software-properties-common
    add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
    apt-get update
    apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev

if you want to build GUI version, do this, otherwise you can skip this step:
    apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler

then get deeponion source from the github:
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/deeponion/deeponion.git

build with autotools:
    cd deeponion
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --with-gui=qt5    (if you want to build daemon, use --without-gui)
    make
