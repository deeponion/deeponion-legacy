    apt-get upgrade
 Â   apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev autoconf automake pkg-config libssl-dev libboost-all-dev bsdmainutils

    apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler

then get deeponion source from the github:
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/deeponion/deeponion.git

build with autotools:
    cd deeponion
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --with-gui=qt5    (if you want to build daemon, use --without-gui)
    make
