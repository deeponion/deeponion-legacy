UNIX BUILD NOTES
================

To Build
--------

cd src/
make -f makefile.unix            # Headless DeepOnion

See readme-qt.rst for instructions on building DeepOnion QT,
the graphical DeepOnion.

Dependencies
------------

 Library     Purpose           Description
 -------     -------           -----------
 libssl      SSL Support       Secure communications
 libdb       Berkeley DB       Blockchain & wallet storage
 libboost    Boost             C++ Library
 miniupnpc   UPnP Support      Optional firewall-jumping support
 libqrencode QRCode generation Optional QRCode generation
 libevent

Note that libexecinfo should be installed, if you building under *BSD systems. 
This library provides backtrace facility.

miniupnpc may be used for UPnP port mapping.  It can be downloaded from
http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/.  UPnP support is compiled in and
turned off by default.  Set USE_UPNP to a different value to control this:
 USE_UPNP=-    No UPnP support - miniupnp not required
 USE_UPNP=0    (the default) UPnP support turned off by default at runtime
 USE_UPNP=1    UPnP support turned on by default at runtime

libqrencode may be used for QRCode image generation. It can be downloaded
from http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.html.en, or installed via
your package manager. Set USE_QRCODE to control this:
 USE_QRCODE=0   (the default) No QRCode support - libqrcode not required
 USE_QRCODE=1   QRCode support enabled

Licenses of statically linked libraries:
 Berkeley DB   New BSD license with additional requirement that linked
               software must be free open source
