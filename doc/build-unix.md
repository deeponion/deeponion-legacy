#### Libraries 

First get the dependencies:

```
apt-get update
apt-get upgrade
apt-get install build-essential libtool autotools-dev autoconf automake pkg-config libssl-dev libboost-all-dev bsdmainutils
apt-get install libqrencode-dev libminiupnpc-dev libevent-dev libcap-dev libseccomp-dev git
```
```
apt-get install software-properties-common
add-apt-repository ppa:bitcoin/bitcoin
apt-get update
apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev
```

#### GUI Version

If you want to build GUI version, do this, otherwise you can skip this step:

```
apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler
```
#### DeepOnion Source

Then get deeponion source:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/deeponion/deeponion.git`

#### Autotools

Build with autotools:

    cd deeponion
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --with-gui=qt5    (if you want to build daemon, use --without-gui)
    make
    
#### Issues

**Debian 9**

It has been reported that under Debian 9 the installation of *libssl1.1-dev* leads to compilation errors. 

If you experience such issues, put *libssl1.0-dev* into your install list.

**Ubuntu 14.04**
