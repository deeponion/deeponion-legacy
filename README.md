=====================================

DeepOnion (ONION) is an anonymous cryptocurrency that is untraceable. All transactions are private and sent through the TOR network.

The integration with TOR ensures that our users are always on a secure environment. There is no client-side configuration needed. Our client will automatically join the TOR network and connect to the available TOR nodes on the network (including our seed nodes). After a successful connection to the DeepOnion network, you may check your displayed IP using DeepOnion client console, where you will see that your client is assigned a hidden TOR address (.onion address).

#### Pluggable Transports
